# Contents:
HTML/   contains static HTML and JS resources, to be served by Apache
PYTHON/ contains python script logic
CONFIG/  contains sample config files for other subsystems (hostapd/dhcpd/fstab)

On a rPi2/3, start with Jessie Lite:
Install Apache2, Python, ICS-dhcpd, hostapd
Install Python libraries using PIP or similar:
  *Tornado
  *RPi.GPIO
  *socket
  *time
  *random
  *json
  *subprocess
  *Queue
  *threading
  *websocket
  
  Copy HTML folder and subdirectories into your apache2 document root
  
  Copy PYTHON  script somewhere executable.
  
  Turn your wifi into a hotspot DNS and DHCP server, with captive redirect of all HTTP requests to your Pi's IP. Use hostapd and DNSMASQ configured as  
  See https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md
  
    
  Configure Apache2 to serve the HTML and JS scripts, and redirect to the correct html file by default. I have the index.html as a quick 'accept terms and conditions' page, with an 'I accept' button that takes you to the numbered html document.
    
  Configure /etc/rc.local to launch the python script on startup.
  
  When all confirmed working, set SD card as read only, and to mount as read-only on boot. See https://hallard.me/raspberry-pi-read-only/
  Also see the fstab in the CONFIG/folder for  a sample.
  Note that the python script will re-mount the USB drive read-write as needed to save sequences.
