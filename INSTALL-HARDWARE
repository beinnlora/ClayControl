##Pi:
rPI2 is fine.
## Wifi USB dongle
Onboard wifi of Rpi3 will work, but not great range. Get one with external antenna for best range/flexibility
## USB flash drive
Any that fits in your enclosure
## Relay board
I use 2x5 channel 5VDC coil TTL trigger boards, generic eBay availability marketed as "Arduino relay board" to give 10 trap capability.
## power supply
The Pi and relay boards run off 12vDC, so the easiest thing is to buy a DC-DC converter of ~1-2A current capacity. these are cheap on the internet.
This controller can share a 12v car battery quite happily with one of the trap batteries. Current consumption is low enough to leave connected all day.
Size the power supply to the peak current draw of the Pi AND when all relay coils are active.
I recommend a reverse polarity protection diode and fuse prior to the DC-DC converter.
## enclosure
I use IP68 enclosures and cable glands througout.

##Mapping GPIO to trap relays
line~180 in the Python code maps the internal trap numbers (1-10) to GPIO pins.
trap2pin=[0,11,15,12,16,35,33,38,36,37,40]

so 
trap 1 is on GPIO 11  referenced by trap2pin[1]
trap 2 is on GPIO 15  referenced by trap2pin[2] etc
(n.b. trap2pin[0] is not used for clarity of code)
